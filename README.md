# Build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals 
> on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike 
> from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, 
> and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- A Bike Sharing company wants to know on the below:
  - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes. 
  - How well those variables describe the bike demands
- dataset - day.csv



## Technologies Used
- Python: 3.8.19 (default, Mar 20 2024, 19:55:45) [MSC v.1916 64 bit (AMD64)]
- pandas: 2.0.3
- numpy: 1.24.3
- Matplotlib: 3.7.2
- sklearn: 1.3.0
- statsmodels: 0.14.0
- seaborn: 0.12.2
- scipy: 1.10.1

## Conclusions
- Linear Regression model with R2 value around 80% is evaluated on test data and can be used for further prediction
